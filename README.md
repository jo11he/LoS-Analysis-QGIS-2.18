# LoS-Analysis-QGIS-2.18

Python2.7 based QGIS2.18 plugin for Line of Sight Analysis to support UAV mission planning

!!! I highly recommend using LosAnalysis_QGIS3 instead !!!

I developed the UAV mission planning plugins using Python2.7 and QGIS2.18. Shortly before publishing, I decided to switch to Python3 and QGIS3 instead. 
Whereas the mathematical methods are the same, this version of the plugin is missing most features that I added for the sake of user friendliness.
I believe, that creating a folder 'LosAnalyzer' in the default QGIS2.18 plugin directory and cloning this repository into the folder, can lead to a successful installation.
However, I did not perform any final tests on this version and once again I would like to recommend using the QGIS3 compatible updated plugins.
For more information on using the plugin, please refer to LosAnalysis_QGIS3.
